# Earth2Studio Recipe Template

This is a template designed to be boiler plate.
All recipes should follow this template as closely as possible
For more information on *what* a recipe is, refer to the [developer documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/earth2studio/userguide/developer/overview.html).

Recipe description here, keep it around a single paragraph.

## Prerequisites

List anything specific a user is expected to have installed / accessible here.
This could be things such as domain knowledge, data of certain type, model checkpoints
etc.

### Software

Pyproject TOML / reqirements.txt handles any Python dependencies.

```bash
uv export --format requirements-txt --no-hashes > requirements.txt
```

If there are system dependencies needed list them here, e.g.

- Docker - minimum version: 23.0.1
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit minimum version: 1.13.5
- PyTorch Image 25.03

### Hardware

If applicable, e.g.

- GPUs: L40, L40S, RTX6000
- CPU: 16 cores
- RAM: â‰¥32GB
- Storage: 16Gb NVMe SSD

## Quick Start

Add a quick start to get the user running with the user up and running as fast as
possible, e.g.

Start by installing the required packages with pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or set up a uv virtual environment:

```bash
uv sync
```

Run the template

```bash
uv run python main.py

>> Hello
>> 0.6.0rc0

uv run python main.py print.hello False

>> 0.6.0rc0
```

## Documentation

Any additional documentation needed to explain to the user different options, APIs, etc.
This can be as extensive or brief as desired.
It is expected for users to interact / modify the source code.
E.g.

Possible options for this template include:

- print.hello : print "Hello"
- print.version : print the version of Earth2Studio package

For more options see [template.yml](cfg/template.yml).
