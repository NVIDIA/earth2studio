# Earth2Studio Cookbook

Welcome to the Earth2Studio cookbook.
This is a collection of different recipes that solve common problems or use cases.
Recipes are **not** designed to be turnkey solutions, but rather reference
boilerplate for users to copy and modify for their specific needs.
Many recipes involve more complex workflows that are too specific, complex or resource
intensive for constitute upstreaming into the broader package.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Earth2Studio and are looking for samples to get started with, first
> visit the [examples page](https://nvidia.github.io/earth2studio/examples/index.html)
> in the documentation.

Recipes are not installable packages.
Users are expected to clone the repository and then interact with the source files
directly.

> [!WARNING]
> Earth2Studio recipes are in beta, thus may dramatically change / get moved.
