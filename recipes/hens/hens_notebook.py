# In this notebook, we will examine ensemble generation for Hurricane Helene, a tropical
# cyclone that made landfall in September 2024.
# The storm posed a challenging case for weather prediction systems and caused
# widespread impacts across the southeastern United States.
#
# The workflow is structured as follows: first, we will set up the most important
# configurations and initialise key objects, then explore their content.
# Following this, we will assemble the perturbation before running the inference.
# Finally, we will visualise the results by plotting the tracks and fields.
#
# **NOTE**: provide links to download (at least two) checkpoints and skill file.
#
# ## Configuring the pipeline
#
# The pipeline requires several configuration parameters to be set.
# We will define the most important ones here and then combine them into a configuration
# object.
#
# The key parameters include:
# - `project`: project name used for output file naming
# - `start_times`: time of initial conditions (multiple ICs can be specified)
# - `nsteps`: number of forecast steps
# - `nensemble`: ensemble size **per checkpoint and IC**
# - `batch_size`: number of forecast steps to run in parallel
# - `model_registry`: path to the registry of model packages
# - `max_num_checkpoints`: maximum number of checkpoints to use
#

# %% [markdown]
# Next we'll load the configuration file using OmegaConf/Hydra.
# The config files are located in the cfg/ folder and use YAML format.
# The helene.yaml config contains the base settings for the Helene case study.
# We'll load it and then override some values programmatically below and apply the
# overrides.

# Next, using hydra conf, the required objects needed for the HENs workflow can get
# instantiated automatically using the `initialise`. If you are familiar with
# Earth2Studio workflows, this is essentially automating the creation of the core
# components such as data sources, prognostic and diagnostic models.

# The initialisation provides us with a number of objects that will be used throughout
# the inference. Let's have a closer look at two of them:
#
# First, we explore the ensemble configs, a list of tuples containing information on
# which model package and initial conditions to use. Additionally, it contains ensemble
# indices and batch IDs assuring these are unique across all processes.
# Let's have a look at the content and explore how many cases we will run, depending on
# number of ensemble members, batch size, number of checkpoints and initial conditions.
#

# %%

    print(f"    package: {pkg}")
    print(f"    initial condition: {ic}")
    print(f"    ensemble index of first member: {ens_idx}")
    print(f"    batch ids to produce: {batch_ids_produce}\n")


# %% [markdown]
# Note that the inference is parallelised across enssemble config elements, hence across
# IC-package pairs. As a result, you cannot use more GPUs than number of ICs multiplied
# by number of checkpoints. If more GPUs are available, they remain idle.
#
# The model dict includes information about the model class and which model weights are
# currently loaded. In addtion, it also holds a pointer to the model loaded to the GPU.
# During infernce, the model dict gets updated according to the information provided in
# the ensemble config. Let's have a look at its contents:

# %%
from termcolor import colored

print(colored("The model class is:", attrs=["bold"]))
print(model_dict["class"], "\n")

print(
    colored("The model package (weights), which is currently loaded:", attrs=["bold"])
)
print(model_dict["package"], "\n")

print(colored("The fully initialised model is provided in:", attrs=["bold"]))
print(model_dict["model"].parameters, "\n")


# %% [markdown]
# Now bring everyhting together:
# - loop over ensemble configs (models)
# - update model dict (if package has changed)
# - initialise output
# - initialise perturbation (as ICs might have changed)
# - run inference, where all ensemble members are produced for a given checkpoint
# - write to disk
#
# This is implemented in the src/hens_run.py file which we encourage users to look at
# and customize as needed.
# The HENS run file can also be executed directly using Hydra CLI if desired.

# After completing the ensemble generation process, the results are stored in the output
# directory. This directory contains both the forecast fields and the cyclone track
# data.
# A seperate output file is created for each checkpoint-IC pair, so if you haven't
# changed the configs, there should be two NETCDF files with field data and one CSV file
# with the tracks.
#
# The field data includes:
# - 4 ensemble members
# - 1 initial condition (time)
# - 17 lead times for each forecast field (IC + 16 forecast steps)
#
# The track data includes detailed information about the storm's position, intensity,
# and other relevant meteorological parameters at each time step.
#
#
# We will now visualise these results. First, let us have a quick look at the global
# field after one day.
# Since the HENS models have a timestep size of 6 hours, the 4th lead time index is
# the forecast at 24 hours.
