        "# Analyse Tropical Cyclone Track Ensembles\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to analyse and validate ensemble tropical cyclone (TC) track predictions. Use this to compare forecast tracks against observations ([IBTrACS](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-best-track-archive)) and reanalysis-based reference tracks (ERA5). We explain the workflow using the example of [Hurricane Helene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Helene), but it can be easily configured to investigate other storms.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Workflow Overview\n",
        "1. Configure case and paths for predicted ensemble and reference track\n",
        "2. Plot track trajectories (spaghetti plot)\n",
        "3. Plot absolute intensities over time (wind speed, MSLP)\n",
        "4. Plot relative intensities over time (normalised by reference)\n",
        "5. Compare ERA5 reference against IBTrACS observations\n",
        "6. Analyse extreme value statistics (histograms)\n",
        "7. Compute error moments over lead time\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Prerequisites\n",
        "- Ensemble of predicted TC tracks (CSV files from tracking algorithm)\n",
        "- Reference track from ERA5 or IBTrACS observations (CSV file)\n",
        "\n",
        "Both can be produced by configuring a `tc_hunt.py` run with cyclone tracking enabled. The ensemble of predicted tracks can, for example, be produced with the config `cfg/helene.yaml`. Reference tracks can be extracted using `cfg/extract_era5.yaml`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Analysis Notes\n",
        "- Track positions are typically well-represented by the model\n",
        "- Intensity metrics (wind speed, pressure) show larger biases due to the coarse (~0.25°) resolution, which cannot fully resolve TC structure\n",
        "- IBTrACS provides observed best track data; ERA5 represents the best achievable reference for reanalysis-driven forecasts\n",
        "\n",
        "### Configuration\n",
        "- `case` - named storm to analyse. Can be expanded with additional named storms by following the pattern `{name}_{YYYY}_{basin}`\n",
        "- `pred_track_dir` - folder containing predicted track CSVs (if using data produced with `cfg/helene.yaml`, this would be `/path/to/outputs_helene/cyclone_tracks_te`)\n",
        "- `tru_track_dir` - folder containing reference track CSV file (if using data produced with `cfg/extract_era5.yaml`, this would be `/path/to/outputs_reference_tracks/`)\n",
        "- `out_dir` - path for storing plots"

Intensities are represented by minimum sea level pressure and maximum wind speed. The reference track should mostly fall within the ensemble spread for intensity predictions. However, some storms exhibit phenomena such as rapid intensification that cannot be adequately captured by models on quarter-degree resolution. In such cases, the reference intensity may lie outside the ensemble spread, indicating model limitations in resolving fine-scale processes."
