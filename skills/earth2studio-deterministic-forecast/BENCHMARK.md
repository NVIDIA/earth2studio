Top findings:

- LOW QUALITY/quality_efficiency: Instructions not in list format (`skills/earth2studio-deterministic-forecast/SKILL.md`)
- LOW SCHEMA/author_format: Author must be of the form 'Name <email@host>' (`skills/earth2studio-deterministic-forecast/SKILL.md`)

## Tier 2: Deduplication Summary

Tier 2 validation reported findings. NVSkills-Eval ran 2 checks and found 1 total findings.

Top findings:

- HIGH DUPLICATE/duplicate: Duplicate content found within SKILL.md:
