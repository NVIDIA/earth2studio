# Frequently Asked Questions

## There is a feature in the docs but not in the pip install package?

By default the docs are tracking the main branch, meaning that there is a chance this is
a new feature that will be a part of the next release.
Make sure you select your installed Earth2Studio version in the docs to see the list of
features present.
If you would like to use a new feature, install from source following the
{ref}`install_guide` guide.

## Will Earth2Studio add XYZ model?

Whether its you're own model or someone else's checkpoint, we are always interested in
making Earth2Studio as feature rich as possible for users.
Open an issue to discuss the model you're interested in using / integrating and we can
work out a plan to get it integrated.
