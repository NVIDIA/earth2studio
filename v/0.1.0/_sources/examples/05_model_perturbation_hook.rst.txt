Model Hook Injection: Perturbation
==========================

Adding model noise by using custom hooks.

This example will demonstrate how to run a an ensemble inference workflow to generate a
perturbed ensemble forecast. This perturbation is done by injecting code into the model
front and rear hooks. These hooks are applied to the tensor data before/after the model forward call.

This example also illustrates how you can subselect data for IO. In this example we will only output
two variables: total column water vapour (tcwv) and 500 hPa geopotential (z500). To run this make
sure that the model selected predicts these variables are change appropriately.

In this example you will learn:

- How to instantiate a built in prognostic model
- Creating a data source and IO object
- Changing the model forward/rear hooks
- Choose a subselection of coordinates to save to an IO object.
- Post-processing results

Creating an Ensemble Workflow
-----------------------------------

To start lets begin with creating an ensemble workflow to use. We encourage
users to explore and experiment with their own custom workflows that borrow ideas from
built in workflows inside :py:obj:`earth2studio.run` or the examples.

Creating our own generalizable ensemble workflow is easy when we rely on the component
interfaces defined in Earth2Studio (use dependency injection). Here we create a run
method that accepts the following:

- time: Input list of datetimes / strings to run inference for
- nsteps: Number of forecast steps to predict
- nensemble: Number of ensembles to run for
- prognostic: Our initialized prognostic model
- data: Initialized data source to fetch initial conditions from
- io: io store that data is written to.
- output_coords: CoordSystem of output coordinates that should be saved. Should be
     a proper subset of model output coordinates.

Set Up
------
With the ensemble workflow defined, we now need to create the indivdual components.

We need the following:

- Prognostic Model: Use the built in DLWP model :py:class:`earth2studio.models.px.DLWP`.
- Datasource: Pull data from the GFS data api :py:class:`earth2studio.data.GFS`.
- IO Backend: Lets save the outputs into a Zarr store :py:class:`earth2studio.io.ZarrBackend`.

We will first run the ensemble workflow using an unmodified function, that is a model that has the
default (identity) forward and rear hooks. Then we will define new hooks for the model and rerun the
inference request.

Execute the Workflow
--------------------
With all componments intialized, running the workflow is a single line of Python code.
Workflow will return the provided IO object back to the user, which can be used to
then post process. Some have additional APIs that can be handy for post-processing or
saving to file. Check the API docs for more information.

Post Processing
---------------
The last step is to post process our results. Cartopy is a greate library for plotting
fields on projects of a sphere. Here we plot and compare the ensemble mean and standard
deviation from using a unperturbed/perturbed model.

Notice that the Zarr IO function has additional APIs to interact with the stored data.
