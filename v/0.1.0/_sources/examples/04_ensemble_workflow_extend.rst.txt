Single Variable Perturbation Method
===================================

Intermediate ensemble inference using a custom perturbation method.

This example will demonstrate how to run a an ensemble inference workflow
with a custom perturbation method that only applies noise to a specific variable.

In this example you will learn:

- How to extend an existing pertubration method
- How to instantiate a built in prognostic model
- Creating a data source and IO object
- Running a simple built in workflow
- Extend a built-in method using custom code.
- Post-processing results

Creating an Ensemble Workflow
-----------------------------------

To start lets begin with creating a ensemble workflow to use. We encourage
users to explore and experiment with their own custom workflows that borrow ideas from
built in workflows inside :py:obj:`earth2studio.run` or the examples.

Creating our own generalizable ensemble workflow is easy when we rely on the component
interfaces defined in Earth2Studio (use dependency injection). Here we create a run
method that accepts the following:

- time: Input list of datetimes / strings to run inference for
- nsteps: Number of forecast steps to predict
- nensemble: Number of ensembles to run for
- prognostic: Our initialized prognostic model
- perturbation_method: Our initialized pertubation method
- data: Initialized data source to fetch initial conditions from
- io: IOBackend

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 58-69

Set Up
------

We need the following:

- Prognostic Model: Use the built in DLWP model :py:class:`earth2studio.models.px.DLWP`.
- perturbation_method: Extend the Spherical Gaussian Method :py:class:`earth2studio.perturbation.SphericalGaussian`.
- Datasource: Pull data from the GFS data api :py:class:`earth2studio.data.GFS`.
- IO Backend: Lets save the outputs into a Zarr store :py:class:`earth2studio.io.ZarrBackend`.

The perturbation method in 02_ensemble_workflow.py is naive because it applies the
same noise amplitude to every variable. We can create a custom wrapper that only
applies the perturbation method to a particular variable instead.

Execute the Workflow
--------------------
With all componments intialized, running the workflow is a single line of Python code.
Workflow will return the provided IO object back to the user, which can be used to
then post process. Some have additional APIs that can be handy for post-processing or
saving to file. Check the API docs for more information.

For the forecast we will predict for 10 steps (for FCN, this is 60 hours) with 8 ensemble
members which will be ran in 2 batches with batch size 4.

Notice that the Zarr IO function has additional APIs to interact with the stored data.
