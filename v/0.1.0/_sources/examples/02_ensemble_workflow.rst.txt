Running Ensemble Inference
==========================

Simple ensemble inference workflow.

This example will demonstrate how to run a simple inference workflow to generate a
ensemble forecast using one of the built in models of Earth-2 Inference
Studio.

In this example you will learn:

- How to instantiate a built in prognostic model
- Creating a data source and IO object
- Select a perturbation method
- Running a simple built in workflow
- Post-processing results

Creating a Simple Ensemble Workflow
-----------------------------------

To start lets begin with creating a simple ensemble workflow to use. We encourage
users to explore and experiment with their own custom workflows that borrow ideas from
built in workflows inside :py:obj:`earth2studio.run` or the examples.

Creating our own generalizable ensemble workflow is easy when we rely on the component
interfaces defined in Earth2Studio (use dependency injection). Here we create a run
method that accepts the following:

- time: Input list of datetimes / strings to run inference for
- nsteps: Number of forecast steps to predict
- nensemble: Number of ensembles to run for
- prognostic: Our initialized prognostic model
- perturbation_method: Our initialized pertubation method
- data: Initialized data source to fetch initial conditions from
- io: IOBackend

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 58-69

Set Up
------

We need the following:

- Prognostic Model: Use the built in FourCastNet model :py:class:`earth2studio.models.px.FCN`.
- perturbation_method: Use the Spherical Gaussian Method :py:class:`earth2studio.perturbation.SphericalGaussian`.
- Datasource: Pull data from the GFS data api :py:class:`earth2studio.data.GFS`.
- IO Backend: Lets save the outputs into a Zarr store :py:class:`earth2studio.io.ZarrBackend`.

    # Create the data source
    data = GFS()

    # Create the IO handler, store in memory
    chunks = {"ensemble": 1, "time": 1}
    io = ZarrBackend(file_name="outputs/02_ensemble_sg.zarr", chunks=chunks)

Execute the Workflow
--------------------
With all componments intialized, running the workflow is a single line of Python code.
Workflow will return the provided IO object back to the user, which can be used to
then post process. Some have additional APIs that can be handy for post-processing or
saving to file. Check the API docs for more information.

For the forecast we will predict for 10 steps (for FCN, this is 60 hours) with 8 ensemble
members which will be ran in 2 batches with batch size 4.

Post Processing
---------------
The last step is to post process our results. Cartopy is a greate library for plotting
fields on projects of a sphere.

Notice that the Zarr IO function has additional APIs to interact with the stored data.
