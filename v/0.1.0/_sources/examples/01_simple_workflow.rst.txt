Running Simple Inference
========================

Simple deterministic inference workflow.

This example will demonstrate how to run a simple inference workflow to generate a
simple determinstic forecast using one of the built in models of Earth-2 Inference
Studio.

In this example you will learn:

- How to instantiate a built in prognostic model
- Creating a data source and IO object
- Running a simple built in workflow
- Post-processing results

Set Up
------
All workflows inside Earth-2 Inference Studio require constructed components to be
handed to them. In this example, lets take a look at the most basic:
:py:meth:`earth2studio.run.deterministic`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 44-47

.. literalinclude:: ../../earth2studio/run.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 35-42

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 49-54

Thus we need the following:

- Prognostic Model: Use the built in FourCastNet Model :py:class:`earth2studio.models.px.FCN`.
- Datasource: Pull data from the GFS data api :py:class:`earth2studio.data.GFS`.
- IO Backend: Lets save the outputs into a Zarr store :py:class:`earth2studio.io.ZarrBackend`.

    from earth2studio.data import GFS
    from earth2studio.io import ZarrBackend
    from earth2studio.models.px import FCN

    # Load the default model package which downloads the check point from NGC
    package = FCN.load_default_package()
    model = FCN.load_model(package)

    # Create the data source
    data = GFS()

    # Create the IO handler, store in memory
    io = ZarrBackend()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 75-84

Execute the Workflow
--------------------
With all componments intialized, running the workflow is a single line of Python code.
Workflow will return the provided IO object back to the user, which can be used to
then post process. Some have additional APIs that can be handy for post-processing or
saving to file. Check the API docs for more information.

For the forecast we will predict for two days (these will get executed as a batch) for
20 forecast steps which is 5 days.

Post Processing
---------------
The last step is to post process our results. Cartopy is a greate library for plotting
fields on projects of a sphere. Here we will just plot the temperature at 2 meters
(t2m) 1 day into the forecast.

Notice that the Zarr IO function has additional APIs to interact with the stored data.
