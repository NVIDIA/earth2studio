Generative Downscaling
========================

Generative downscaling over Taiwan using CorrDiff diffusion model.

This example will demonstrate how to user Nvidia's CorrDiff model, trained for
predicting weather over Taiwan, to perform generative downscaling from quarter degree
global forecast data to ~3km.

This checkpoint was trained on ERA5 data and WRF data that spans 2018-2021 at one hour
time resolution. In this example, we demonstrate an application to GFS data for a typhoon
super-resolution from 2023. The model's performance on GFS data and on data from this year
has not been evaluated.

In this example you will learn:

- Creating a custom workflow for running CorrDiff inference
- Creating a data-source for CorrDiff's input
- Initializing and running CorrDiff diagnostic model
- Post-processing results.

Creating a Simple CorrDiff Workflow
-----------------------------------

As usual, we start with creating a simple workflow to run CorrDiff in. To maximize the
generalization of this workflow, we use dependency injection following the pattern
provided inside :py:obj:`earth2studio.run`. Since CorrDiff is a diagnostic model, this
workflow won't predict a time-series, rather just an instantaneous prediction.


For this workflow, we specify

- time: Input list of datetimes / strings to run inference for
- corrdiff: The initialized CorrDiffTaiwan model
- data: Initialized data source to fetch initial conditions from
- io: IOBackend
- number_of_samples: Number of samples to generate from the model

Set Up
------
With the workflow defined, the next step is initializing the needed components from
Earth-2 studio

It's clear we need the following:

- Diagnostic Model: CorrDiff model for Taiwan :py:class:`earth2studio.models.dx.CorrDiffTaiwan`.
- Datasource: Pull data from the GFS data api :py:class:`earth2studio.data.GFS`.
- IO Backend: Save the outputs into a Zarr store :py:class:`earth2studio.io.ZarrBackend`.

    /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/modulus/models/module.py:360: FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.

Execute the Workflow
--------------------
With all components initialized, running the workflow is a single line of Python code.
Workflow will return the provided IO object back to the user, which can be used to
then post process. Some have additional APIs that can be handy for post-processing or
saving to file. Check the API docs for more information.

For the inference we will predict 1 sample for a particular timestamp representing
Typhoon Koinu.

Post Processing
---------------
The last step is to post process our results. Cartopy is a great library for plotting
fields on projections of a sphere.

Notice that the Zarr IO function has additional APIs to interact with the stored data.
