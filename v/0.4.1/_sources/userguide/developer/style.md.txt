# Style Guide

The Earth2Studio style guide is set of conventions we have adopted detailing how to
write code for this project. A consistent style and process makes the package much
easier to understand for users and ensure compliance requirements are met.

## Code Formatting

Earth2Studio uses [black](https://github.com/psf/black) as the code formatter.
All committed code is expected to be compliant with the version of black specified in
the [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/NVIDIA/earth2studio/blob/main/pyproject.toml).
Pre-commit will format your code for you or one can run `make format` to run black on
all files.

Additional Code formatting principles:

- Files are always lower-case reflecting, use shortened name of component they hold
- Class names are capitalized using camel-case
- Function names are lower case using snake-case

## Linting

Linting is performed by [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) which includes many
processes to ensure code between files is as consistent as possible.
Ruff is configured in the projects [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/NVIDIA/earth2studio/blob/main/pyproject.toml).
Pre-commit will run linting for you or one can run `make lint` to run ruff on all files.

## Type Hints

Earth2Studio is a [MyPy](https://mypy-lang.org/) compliant package, meaning type hints
are required for all functions (parameters and return object).
MyPy is configured in the packages [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/NVIDIA/earth2studio/blob/main/pyproject.toml).
On top of requiring type hints, the following guidelines should be used:

- To help keep APIs a concise, several of the common types used through out
    the package are defined in `earth2studio/utils/type.py` which should be
    used when applicable.

```{literalinclude} ../../../earth2studio/utils/type.py
:lines: 17-
:language: python
```

- Earth2Studio is Python 3.10+, thus type hinting using generic objects should be used
    instead of the `typing` package. See [PEP 585](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/)
    for details.

- Earth2Studio is Python 3.10+, thus the `|` operator should be used instead of `Union`
    and `Optional` type operators. See [PEP 604](https://peps.python.org/pep-0604/) for
    details.

:::{note}
The pre-commit hook [PyUpgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade) will enforce
Python 3.10 type styles automatically.

## Signing Your Work

We **require** that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that
the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same
license, or a compatible license. Any contribution which contains commits that are not
Signed-Off will not be accepted.

To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when
committing your changes:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Adding a cool feature."
```

This will append the following to your commit message:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
```
