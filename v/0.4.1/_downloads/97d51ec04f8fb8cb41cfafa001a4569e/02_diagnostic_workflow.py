Running Diagnostic Inference
============================

Basic prognostic + diagnostic inference workflow.

This example will demonstrate how to run a deterministic inference workflow that couples
a prognostic model with a diagnostic model. This diagnostic model will predict a new
atmospheric quantity from the predicted fields of the prognostic.

In this example you will learn:

- How to instantiate a prognostic model
- How to instantiate a diagnostic model
- Creating a data source and IO object
- Running the built in diagnostic workflow
- Post-processing results
"""

# %%
# Set Up
# ------
# For this example, the built in diagnostic workflow :py:meth:`earth2studio.run.diagnostic`
# will be used.

# %%
# .. literalinclude:: ../../earth2studio/run.py
#    :language: python
#    :start-after: # sphinx - diagnostic start
#    :end-before: # sphinx - diagnostic end


# %%
# Thus, we need the following:
#
# - Prognostic Model: Use the built in FourCastNet Model :py:class:`earth2studio.models.px.FCN`.
# - Diagnostic Model: Use the built in precipitation AFNO model :py:class:`earth2studio.models.dx.PrecipitationAFNO`.
# - Datasource: Pull data from the GFS data api :py:class:`earth2studio.data.GFS`.
# - IO Backend: Save the outputs into a Zarr store :py:class:`earth2studio.io.ZarrBackend`.

# %%
import os

os.makedirs("outputs", exist_ok=True)
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()  # TODO: make common example prep function

from earth2studio.data import GFS
from earth2studio.io import ZarrBackend
from earth2studio.models.dx import PrecipitationAFNO
from earth2studio.models.px import FCN

# Load the default model package which downloads the check point from NGC
package = FCN.load_default_package()
prognostic_model = FCN.load_model(package)

package = PrecipitationAFNO.load_default_package()
diagnostic_model = PrecipitationAFNO.load_model(package)

# Create the data source
data = GFS()

# Create the IO handler, store in memory
io = ZarrBackend()

# %%
# Execute the Workflow
# --------------------
# With all components initialized, running the workflow is a single line of Python code.
# Workflow will return the provided IO object back to the user, which can be used to
# then post process. Some have additional APIs that can be handy for post-processing or
# saving to file. Check the API docs for more information.

# %%
import earth2studio.run as run

nsteps = 8
io = run.diagnostic(
    ["2021-06-01"], nsteps, prognostic_model, diagnostic_model, data, io
)

print(io.root.tree())

# %%
# Post Processing
# ---------------
# The last step is to plot the resulting predicted total precipitation. The power of
# diagnostic models is that they allow the prediction of any variable from a pre-trained
# prognostic model.
#
# .. note::
#   The built in workflow will only save the direct outputs of the diagnostic. In this
#   example only total precipitation is accessible for plotting. If you wish to save
#   outputs of both the prognostic and diagnostic, we recommend writing a custom
#   workflow.
