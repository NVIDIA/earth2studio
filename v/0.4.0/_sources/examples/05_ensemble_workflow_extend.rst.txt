Single Variable Perturbation Method
===================================

Intermediate ensemble inference using a custom perturbation method.

This example will demonstrate how to run a an ensemble inference workflow
with a custom perturbation method that only applies noise to a specific variable.

In this example you will learn:

- How to extend an existing pertubration method
- How to instantiate a built in prognostic model
- Creating a data source and IO object
- Running a simple built in workflow
- Extend a built-in method using custom code.
- Post-processing results

Set Up
------
All workflows inside Earth2Studio require constructed components to be
handed to them. In this example, we will use the built in ensemble workflow
:py:meth:`earth2studio.run.ensemble`.

We need the following:

- Prognostic Model: Use the built in DLWP model :py:class:`earth2studio.models.px.DLWP`.
- perturbation_method: Extend the Spherical Gaussian Method :py:class:`earth2studio.perturbation.SphericalGaussian`.
- Datasource: Pull data from the GFS data api :py:class:`earth2studio.data.GFS`.
- IO Backend: Save the outputs into a Zarr store :py:class:`earth2studio.io.ZarrBackend`.

    /localhome/user/miniconda3/envs/studio/lib/python3.11/site-packages/modulus/models/module.py:360: FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.

The perturbation method in :ref:`sphx_glr_examples_03_ensemble_workflow.py` is naive because it
applies the same noise amplitude to every variable. We can create a custom wrapper
that only applies the perturbation method to a particular variable instead.

Execute the Workflow
--------------------
With all components initialized, running the workflow is a single line of Python code.
Workflow will return the provided IO object back to the user, which can be used to
then post process. Some have additional APIs that can be handy for post-processing or
saving to file. Check the API docs for more information.

For the forecast we will predict for 10 steps (for FCN, this is 60 hours) with 8 ensemble
members which will be ran in 2 batches with batch size 4.

Post Processing
---------------
The last step is to post process our results. Lets plot both the perturbed t2m field
and also the unperturbed tcwv field. First to confirm the perturbation method works as
expect, the initial state is plotted.

Notice that the Zarr IO function has additional APIs to interact with the stored data.

have some uncertainty for later lead times. Here the total column water vapor is
plotted at a lead time of 24 hours, note the variance in the members despite just
perturbing the temperature field.
