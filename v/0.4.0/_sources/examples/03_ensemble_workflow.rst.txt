Running Ensemble Inference
==========================

Simple ensemble inference workflow.

This example will demonstrate how to run a simple inference workflow to generate a
ensemble forecast using one of the built in models of Earth-2 Inference
Studio.

In this example you will learn:

- How to instantiate a built in prognostic model
- Creating a data source and IO object
- Select a perturbation method
- Running a simple built in workflow for ensembling
- Post-processing results

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 38-43

Set Up
------
All workflows inside Earth2Studio require constructed components to be
handed to them. In this example, we will use the built in ensemble workflow
:py:meth:`earth2studio.run.ensemble`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 45-49

.. literalinclude:: ../../earth2studio/run.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # sphinx - ensemble start
   :end-before: # sphinx - ensemble end

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 51-57

We need the following:

- Prognostic Model: Use the built in FourCastNet model :py:class:`earth2studio.models.px.FCN`.
- perturbation_method: Use the Spherical Gaussian Method :py:class:`earth2studio.perturbation.SphericalGaussian`.
- Datasource: Pull data from the GFS data api :py:class:`earth2studio.data.GFS`.
- IO Backend: Save the outputs into a Zarr store :py:class:`earth2studio.io.ZarrBackend`.

    /localhome/user/miniconda3/envs/studio/lib/python3.11/site-packages/modulus/models/module.py:360: FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.

Execute the Workflow
--------------------
With all components initialized, running the workflow is a single line of Python code.
Workflow will return the provided IO object back to the user, which can be used to
then post process. Some have additional APIs that can be handy for post-processing or
saving to file. Check the API docs for more information.

For the forecast we will predict for 10 steps (for FCN, this is 60 hours) with 8 ensemble
members which will be ran in 2 batches with batch size 4.

Post Processing
---------------
The last step is to post process our results. Cartopy is a great library for plotting
fields on projections of a sphere.

Notice that the Zarr IO function has additional APIs to interact with the stored data.
