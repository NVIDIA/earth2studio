Running Deterministic Inference
===============================

Basic deterministic inference workflow.

This example will demonstrate how to run a simple inference workflow to generate a
basic determinstic forecast using one of the built in models of Earth-2 Inference
Studio.

In this example you will learn:

- How to instantiate a built in prognostic model
- Creating a data source and IO object
- Running a simple built in workflow
- Post-processing results

Set Up
------
All workflows inside Earth2Studio require constructed components to be
handed to them. In this example, let's take a look at the most basic:
:py:meth:`earth2studio.run.deterministic`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 44-48

.. literalinclude:: ../../earth2studio/run.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # sphinx - deterministic start
   :end-before: # sphinx - deterministic end

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 50-55

Thus, we need the following:

- Prognostic Model: Use the built in FourCastNet Model :py:class:`earth2studio.models.px.FCN`.
- Datasource: Pull data from the GFS data api :py:class:`earth2studio.data.GFS`.
- IO Backend: Let's save the outputs into a Zarr store :py:class:`earth2studio.io.ZarrBackend`.

Execute the Workflow
--------------------
With all components initialized, running the workflow is a single line of Python code.
Workflow will return the provided IO object back to the user, which can be used to
then post process. Some have additional APIs that can be handy for post-processing or
saving to file. Check the API docs for more information.

For the forecast we will predict for two days (these will get executed as a batch) for
20 forecast steps which is 5 days.

Post Processing
---------------
The last step is to post process our results. Cartopy is a great library for plotting
fields on projections of a sphere. Here we will just plot the temperature at 2 meters
(t2m) 1 day into the forecast.

Notice that the Zarr IO function has additional APIs to interact with the stored data.
