# Batch Functions

This section of the userguide expands on how batching is handled inside Earth2Studio.
As discussed in [data movement](data_userguide) section, there is a dedicated coordinate
axis `batch` which is commonly used in many of the model implementations.
This represents a dynamic axis that can be of any size.
