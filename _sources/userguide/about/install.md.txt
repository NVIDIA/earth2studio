:::{admonition} Base Install Limitations
:class: warning

The base pip install does not guarantee all functionality and/or examples are
operational due to optional dependencies.
We encourage users that face package issues to familiarize themselves with the optional
model installs and suggested environment set up for the most complete experience.
:::

## Install using Pip

To get the latest release of Earth2Studio, install from the Python index:

```bash
pip install earth2studio
```

## Install using uv (recommended)

This package is developed using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
and it's recommended that users use an uv project for the best install experience:

```bash
mkdir earth2studio-project && cd earth2studio-project
uv init --python=3.12
uv add "earth2studio @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/earth2studio.git@0.8.1"
```

:::{admonition} uv install
:class: note

The use of the latest git release tag for the package install with uv is intentional.
This will allow uv to handle any complicated dependency conditions and automatically
handle url based dependencies.
This is not achievable using the [pypi registry](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/#transitive-url-dependencies)
but makes installing optional packages much easier down the line.
:::

## Install Main Branch

To install the latest main branch version of Earth2Studio main branch:

```bash
pip install "earth2studio @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/earth2studio"
```

or if you are using uv:

```bash
uv add "earth2studio @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/earth2studio.git"
```

## Verify Installation

```bash
python
# or when using uv
uv run python

>>> import earth2studio
>>> earth2studio.__version__
```

## Optional Dependencies

:::{admonition} uv Package Manager
:class: tip
For developers [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
should be used.
uv is **not required** for just using Earth2Studio thus both pip and uv commands are
included.
uv commands assume Earth2Studio has already been added to the project using *git source*
used in the above sections.

### Submodule Dependencies

A few features in various submodules require some specific dependencies that have been
deemed too specific to warrant an addition to the core dependencies.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} pip

```bash
pip install earth2studio[data]

```

:::
:::{tab-item} uv

```bash
uv add earth2studio --extra statistics
```

:::
::::
:::::
::::::

### Install All Optional Dependencies

In Earth2Studio, it's recommended that users pick and choose the optional dependencies that
are needed for their use case.
Installing everything at once and for all models is only expected to work in a few
specific environments and may not include support for every model depending on
conflicts.
This is only supported using uv and when using github as the source, [not pypi registry](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/#transitive-url-dependencies).
To install a best effort all optional dependencies group, use the following:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} uv

```bash
uv sync
uv add earth2studio --extra all
```

:::
::::

(install_environments)=

# Environments

For the best experience, we recommend creating a fresh environment whether that be using
uv, a Docker container or even a Conda environment.
Below are some recipes for creating a handful of environments for setting up
Earth2Studio in an isolated environment.
For developer environments, please refer to the {ref}`developer_overview`.

## uv Project

Using uv is the recommend way to set up a local Python environment for Earth2Studio.
Assuming [uv is installed](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), use
the following commands:

```bash
mkdir earth2studio-project && cd earth2studio-project
uv init --python=3.12
uv add "earth2studio @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/earth2studio.git@0.8.1"
```

or if you are already inside an existing uv project:

```bash
uv venv --python=3.12
uv add "earth2studio @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/earth2studio.git@0.8.1"
```

(pytorch_container_environment)=

## PyTorch Docker Container

For a docker environment the [Nvidia PyTorch container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch)
provides a good base with many dependencies already installed and optimized for NVIDIA
hardware.
In container instances, using a virtual environment is often [not necessary](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/#using-arbitrary-python-environments).
It is recommend using the following commands to install using the container's Python
interpreter:

```bash
docker run -it -t nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.05-py3

>>> apt-get update && apt-get install -y git make curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
>>> unset PIP_CONSTRAINT
>>> curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh && source $HOME/.local/bin/env
>>> uv pip install --system --break-system-packages "earth2studio@git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/earth2studio.git@0.8.1"
```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
:::{admonition} Extra Dependencies
:class: note

To add extra dependencies adjust the `uv pip install` command like you would normally
do with pip e.g.

```bash
uv pip install --system \
    --break-system-packages \
    "earth2studio[all]@git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/earth2studio.git@0.8.1"
```

:::

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

## Custom Container

For a dedicated docker container the following can be used to get started.
There is some complexity to undo the pip constraints from the PyTorch container, but
otherwise the install process is the same.

```dockerfile
FROM nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.05-py3
COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.6.13 /uv /uvx /bin/

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    make \
    curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /app

# Disable contraint files in the container
ENV PIP_CONSTRAINT=
# Install Earth2Studio and dependencies
RUN uv pip install --system --break-system-packages "earth2studio@git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/earth2studio.git@0.8.1"
```

## Conda Environment

It is no longer recommend to use any conda environment manager for Earth2Studio in favor
of uv if possible.
This is because the virtual environments set up by uv makes the system-wide conda
environments not needed unless some system dependencies are required.
However this demonstrates that in principle Earth2Studio can be installed using standard
package tooling.

```bash
conda create -n earth2studio python=3.12
conda activate earth2studio

uv pip install --system --break-system-packages "earth2studio@git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/earth2studio.git@0.8.1"
```

# System Recommendations

## Software

Earth2Studio does not have any specific software version requirements.
The following are recommended to closely match development and automation environments,
minimizing the chance for unforeseen incompatibilities:

- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Python Version: 3.12
- CUDA Version: 12.8

## Hardware

Earth2Studio does not have any specific hardware requirements, if PyTorch can run then
many features of Earth2Studio should run as well.
However, most models do require a GPU with sufficient memory and compute score to run
without complications.
The recommended hardware for the majority of models supported in Earth2Studio is:

| GPU | GPU Memory (GB) | Precision | # of GPUs | Disk Space (GB) |
|-----|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| [NVIDIA GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) with compute capability ≥ 8.9 | ≥40 | FP32 | 1 | 128 |

This includes cards such as:

- L40S
- RTX A6000
- H100
- B200

We encourage users to experiment on different hardware for their specific needs and
usecase.

(configuration_userguide)=

# Configuration

Earth2Studio uses a few environment variables to configure various parts of the package.
The important ones are:

- `EARTH2STUDIO_CACHE`: The location of the cache used for Earth2Studio. This is a file
path where things like models and cached data from data sources will be stored.
- `EARTH2STUDIO_PACKAGE_TIMEOUT`: The max number of seconds for a download operation of
a model package file from a remote store such as NGC, Huggingface or S3.
