Running Deterministic Inference
===============================

Basic deterministic inference workflow.

This example will demonstrate how to run a simple inference workflow to generate a
basic determinstic forecast using one of the built in models of Earth-2 Inference
Studio.

In this example you will learn:

- How to instantiate a built in prognostic model
- Creating a data source and IO object
- Running a simple built in workflow
- Post-processing results

Set Up
------
All workflows inside Earth2Studio require constructed components to be
handed to them. In this example, let's take a look at the most basic:
:py:meth:`earth2studio.run.deterministic`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 44-48

.. literalinclude:: ../../earth2studio/run.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # sphinx - deterministic start
   :end-before: # sphinx - deterministic end

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 50-55

Thus, we need the following:

- Prognostic Model: Use the built in FourCastNet Model :py:class:`earth2studio.models.px.FCN`.
- Datasource: Pull data from the GFS data api :py:class:`earth2studio.data.GFS`.
- IO Backend: Let's save the outputs into a Zarr store :py:class:`earth2studio.io.ZarrBackend`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 57-78

.. code-block:: Python

    import os

    os.makedirs("outputs", exist_ok=True)
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    load_dotenv()  # TODO: make common example prep function

    from earth2studio.data import GFS
    from earth2studio.io import ZarrBackend
    from earth2studio.models.px import Aurora

    # Load the default model package which downloads the check point from NGC
    package = Aurora.load_default_package()
    model = Aurora.load_model(package)

    # Create the data source
    data = GFS()

    # Create the IO handler, store in memory
    io = ZarrBackend()

Execute the Workflow
--------------------
With all components initialized, running the workflow is a single line of Python code.
Workflow will return the provided IO object back to the user, which can be used to
then post process. Some have additional APIs that can be handy for post-processing or
saving to file. Check the API docs for more information.

For the forecast we will predict for two days (these will get executed as a batch) for
20 forecast steps which is 5 days.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 90-97

.. code-block:: Python

    import earth2studio.run as run

    nsteps = 20
    io = run.deterministic(["2024-01-01"], nsteps, model, data, io)

    print(io.root.tree())


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 98-105

Post Processing
---------------
The last step is to post process our results. Cartopy is a great library for plotting
fields on projections of a sphere. Here we will just plot the temperature at 2 meters
(t2m) 1 day into the forecast.

Notice that the Zarr IO function has additional APIs to interact with the stored data.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 107-137

.. code-block:: Python

    import cartopy.crs as ccrs
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    forecast = "2024-01-01"
    variable = "t2m"
    step = 4  # lead time = 24 hrs

    plt.close("all")
    # Create a Robinson projection
    projection = ccrs.Robinson()

    # Create a figure and axes with the specified projection
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={"projection": projection}, figsize=(10, 6))

    # Plot the field using pcolormesh
    im = ax.pcolormesh(
        io["lon"][:],
        io["lat"][:],
        io[variable][0, step],
        transform=ccrs.PlateCarree(),
        cmap="Spectral_r",
    )

    # Set title
    ax.set_title(f"{forecast} - Lead time: {6*step}hrs")

    # Add coastlines and gridlines
    ax.coastlines()
    ax.gridlines()
    plt.savefig("outputs/01_t2m_prediction.jpg")
